This is the problems we saw in the “Earth Song”, by Michael Jackson:
- Deforestation (Forest fires, cutting trees, lumber, …)
- animal extinction / endangered species (ivory, skin fur, illegal hunting (=poaching))
- air pollution (industry, exhaust fumes (factories), fires, traffic)
- Climatic changes (drought, floods, melting ice caps, tornado, storm, hurricane, dap doo doo doo dap doo doo doo)
- Global warming
- Soil pollution
- Greenhouse effect
- Ozone layer depletion
