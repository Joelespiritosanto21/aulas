Joel - Have you ever noticed we always do what we have to do on the last minute?

Tiago - Yeah. When i think about doing something i always get overwhelmed just thinking about what i have to do and i never actually do it.

Joel - That's why your school projects and work projects never get done... You're always so lazy.

Tiago - I tried lots of things but nothing actually worked.

Joel - Have you ever tried get yourself motivated to do something? Like, force yourself to do something you need to do.

Tiago - I have literally 0 willpower. I can't force myself to do anything even if i try. even if i do it it will be much slower than if i actually wanted to do it and was engaged on the task.

Joel - So, you need to be motived by someone in order for you to get your tasks done... I dont know if i call that procrastination or just laziness...

Tiago - I don't think motivation is the issue. I'm an anxious person, i start doing something and i'm already thinking on something that will only happen far in the future and i don't
focus on the things i have to do right now.

Joel - So, how you get your tasks done if you cant even focus. Anxious person? Why dont you ask a doctor for help on that? There's pills for anxiety.

Tiago - Honestly not even I know. But if i think about it, sometimes i start doing a small thing on a project when when i see it I'm bug fixing the whole code.

Joel - Dang. That's kinda awful. How can you just going to fix a bug and endup rewriting the all god dam code?

Tiago - That's not the point. What i'm trying to say is that maybe you have to start doing a small thing related to the task or just set yourself to do it for 5 minutes. After that time has passed you will not want to switch to another task, you'd rather stay on what you're doing right now than switching to another task so you continue doing that when when you realize it hours have past.

**Joel** - Well, then the solution is simple... set a timer and force yourself to switch tasks.

**Tiago** - Sounds simple, but in practice... I set the timer, and then I find myself scrolling through reels on Instagram without even realizing it.

**Joel** - But isn’t that why the timer exists? To prevent that?

**Tiago** - Yeah, in theory. But when I'm anxious, the timer just reminds me of how much time I have left, which makes it worse. I start thinking about what comes next instead of focusing on what I'm doing.

**Joel** - How do you manage to get anything done then?

**Tiago** - I do, but it’s chaotic. I’ll start on something small, and next thing I know, I’m fixing half the project. It feels like I can only focus when I’m on the brink of a meltdown.

**Joel** - That sounds rough. You might want to try some proper time management techniques.

**Tiago** - I’ve thought about it, but I worry that without the anxiety, I won’t be productive at all.

**Joel** - That’s a dangerous mindset. You don’t want to burn out.

**Tiago** - True. Maybe I should look into it more seriously.

**Joel** - If you want, I can join you. We could try some productivity challenges together.

**Tiago** - Deal. Just don’t come crying to me when you end up knee-deep in unnecessary fixes.

**Joel** - (laughs) I’ll hold you to that!
