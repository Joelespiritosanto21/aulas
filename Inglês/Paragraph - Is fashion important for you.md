Fashion, nowadays, is something really important for most of us. However, for me, that's not really the case. All i care in clothes it's the quality and not really the brand. I don’t feel the same pull towards brands or trends. What I value most in clothing is quality, simple and reliable pieces that are comfortable and built to last. I’m not interested in a fancy logo or an expensive label if the item doesn’t feel right or hold up over time.
